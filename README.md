# Consultancy Agency Landing Page

This project is a modern and dynamic landing page for "FlujoDigital," a consultancy agency specializing in digital transformation for small businesses. It's designed to showcase the agency's services, expertise, and provide clear calls to action for potential clients.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this landing page is to create a compelling online presence for FlujoDigital. It highlights services such as process automation, business intelligence, AI-powered chatbots, and digital security. The design focuses on a professional, tech-forward aesthetic with smooth animations and a clear user journey.

This project serves as a practical example of my skills in frontend development, UI/UX design considerations, and creating responsive web applications.

## Tech Stack & Key Features

This landing page is built with a modern frontend stack:

*   **React:** For building a component-based and interactive user interface.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development and a consistent design system.
*   **Framer Motion:** Implemented for engaging animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience.
*   **Lucide React:** For clean and consistent iconography.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing and interaction across a wide range of devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
*   **SEO Best Practices:** Initial considerations for SEO have been implemented, including semantic HTML and meta tags (managed via `react-helmet-async` - *assuming this based on previous interactions, adjust if not used*).
*   **Dynamic Content Sections:** Sections for services, featured products, target audience, and contact information.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Smooth scrolling navigation, animated call-to-action buttons, and a contact form.
*   **Video Background:** Utilized in the hero section for a dynamic visual impact.

## Deployment

The site is configured for easy deployment on **Vercel**, leveraging its capabilities for hosting static sites and SPAs. The `vercel.json` file in the root directory handles build configurations and routing for a Single Page Application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with the main React application residing in the `/frontend` directory.
